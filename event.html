            <p>First, the prizes were distributed to the students. I got a certificate for holding second position in Essay writing competition. Then our Principal announced on the stage that the story â€“ â€˜The Mirageâ€™ will begin. The story began and after that a dance performance took place. I was standing in the stage wing because after the performance it was my chance to go on the stage.  I went and spoke my dialogues. When I came back, my teacher patted my back and said that she loved my performance. We were then given the refreshments at the backstage. We also played games with our teachers.
                
                After a song performance, a photograph was clicked of all the participants on stage. In the end, our Principal congratulated the students and the teachers who were in charge. After that, we all went to meet our parents. I introduced my parents to my teachers. Then we changed our costumed. It was a wonderful event. I will cherish it forever.
